We ordered French fries and desserts. Odd combination, I know, but that was the mood we were in lol.
Both the desserts were superb and so pleasing to the eyes. Didn't quite like the BBQ sauce that came along with the French fries but we asked for mayo instead. </p>
The staff members are very courteous and I can say it many times over. Very very friendly and polite service. Loved it!
Unlike the other CCD's , this one has got a bunch of snacking options!</em>
